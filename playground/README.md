# Aim Trainer Game

This is a simple aim trainer game built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction). The goal of the game is to click as many targets as possible within the time limit.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## How to Play

- Move your mouse to aim.
- Click on the targets to destroy them.
- Try to destroy as many targets as you can before the time runs out.
